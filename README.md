### Hello there ðŸ‘‹
If you are here that means you want to know more about me and that's great!

- ðŸŽ“ Iâ€™m currently studying a High performance computing master. Discovering new things.
- âœ¨ My main interents include compilers, computer architecture, language design, networking and computer graphics, but I still haven't settled for anything.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently trying to contribute more to open source
- ðŸ’« The languages I have more experience with are Rust, C++, Javascript, Typescript and Python, but I have also used Haskell, Go, C, Ruby, Zig, C# and Nim.
- ðŸ¤¯ If you want more information, you can check out my personal page at [castillodel.github.io](castillodel.github.io)
- ðŸ“š You can also check out my [other GitHub account](https://github.com/Daniel-del-Castillo) where you can find the projects I made as assignments for the university


ðŸ“Š Some stats about my Github:

[![Anurag's GitHub stats](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=CastilloDel&theme=tokyonight&hide=stars&show_icons=true)](https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats)

[![Top Langs](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/top-langs/?username=CastilloDel&layout=compact&langs_count=10&hide=GLSL&theme=tokyonight)](https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats)

I like this language stats, but I also feel they aren't completely representative. They don't take into account work that I've done in repos I don't own or that started in my other GitHub account, so take it with a grain of salt!
